Custom Bash Shell
--------------------

A program that can run bash commands like in Terminal.

If the input contains a combination of pipe and redirection operation the it is
assumed that input redirection will always be first among the subcommands of the
pipe and output redirections will always be the last.

While using !histn command the nth command is relaced int the place where !histn
was there so history will not contain !histn command but the nth command. The
same is reflected in pid all command.

In pipes all the sub commands of the pipe are taken to be seperate processes and
thus are seperately displayed in pid all command.

Some commands like cd hist pid (user defined) are not executed by forking and
thus have the pid of the parent(main) process.
